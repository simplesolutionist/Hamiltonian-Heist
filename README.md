# Hamiltonian-Heist
A game in which the user stands at a point or selects a point to start from and then must navigate through a Hamiltonian circuit.
Each time they collect the treasures, they advance to a more rigorous circuit. 
If they get caught by a boss/enemy, they are brought back to the same circuit and must restart the level to advance to the next level.
There are 3 levels, an option to have background music being played in the background, and an option to choose which character you want to play as.
